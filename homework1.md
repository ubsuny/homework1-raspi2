## Homework 1 with Rasp. pi 2
### Akash

For this homework I am using the FFT problem we were trying to solve in the class itself as i thought it has more packages needed to install.

To this homework om my raspberry pi 2 model B, I did following steps.

* First I inserted the SD card with Rasbian OS installed in it. I set it up with my LAN network.
* For my FFT problem I added requires files to read the data as well as to perform the fourier transform. Once done with that I opened my **.ipnb** file in Jupyter notebook.
* based on what kind of the error it was showing for the modules, which was **Numpy and Matplotlib** , I installed those files using **PIP3**. 
* It was working for me like that and I solved the problem.
